    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago! With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup very finely chopped pecans</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gradually mix in flour, pecans, and salt until completely incorporated. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light golden brown but tops are still pale, 12 to 15 minutes. (Try not to let cookies get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them.)</li>
        <li>Remove cookies from the oven and let sit on the baking sheets briefly before removing to wire racks.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 cup powdered sugar in a shallow bowl; roll hot cookies in sugar to coat, then return to the wire racks to cool. Once cooled, roll cookies in the powdered sugar once more.</li>
    </ol>
